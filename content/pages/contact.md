My name is Ahmed and I am a backend engineer. I have been developing applications for around 3 years. Most of my experience lies in full-stack development scripting/scraping/automation and server administration. I have worked with Javascript/NodeJS C#, PHP,  Electron, Puppeteer, Selinum, React, Vue, Ember, and a little bit of Go and Python.

Also, I have founded a Startup **(04 Egypt)** on the 1st of 2018 for building AI-based applications and chatbots weâ€™ve raised a seed investment from an Angel Investor, we managed to get Dubai Courts to be our first client and we have built plotai.io  (Slack-like platform, Driven with AI ). But, for some financial reasons, we had to close on the 1st of 2020, through these 2 years I have worked with more than 40 Devs/tester/Devops/and shareholders.
